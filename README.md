To be able to run this project, You'll need to insall pods first.
Checkout more about cocopods here: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html
And how to install cocopods in your machine: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/installing-and-using-cocoapods-for-ios

If you already have pods in your machine, then just 
do cd link to your project in terminal
then do pod install - this will install all the dependencies for this project.

Once you have all the dependencies from pod install, open the workspace (not xcode poject) and run it.

For tests - I've demoed how to test api calls using Quick, Nimble and MockingJay frameworks
